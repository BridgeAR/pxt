\begin{abstract}
    Microcontrollers, the low-power low-cost workhorses of embedded systems, form the majority of programmable devices in the world. Traditionally, because microcontrollers are so resource constrained in terms of processing speed, memory and power consumption, they are programmed in low-level languages like C and C++. The programming tools are often complex to set up, learn and use, and specific to individual microcontrollers. As a result, microcontroller programming requires very particular skills.

    We present a new programming platform that makes it easier for \emph{anyone} to program microcontrollers. We aim to leverage today's lightweight tooling to allow code to be developed \emph{anywhere}, requiring only a computer with a modern web browser and a USB port. Finally, we describe how our platform has been architected to bridge between the Web and relatively impoverished microcontrollers, in accordance with our aspiration to program (\emph{anything}) in a more accessible manner.

    With the predicted growth of the Internet of Things we believe that a system such as ours, which enables both novices and developers from diverse backgrounds to develop microcontroller code quickly, will become increasingly valuable. After describing our platform in detail, we evaluate performance on a range of modern low-end microcontrollers, before ending with a review of related work.
