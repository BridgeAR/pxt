    Across the globe, it is now commonplace for educators to engage in the making (design and development) of embedded systems in the classroom to motivate and excite their students. This new domain brings its own set of unique requirements. Historically, embedded systems development requires knowledge of low-level programming languages, local installation of compilation toolchains, device drivers and applications. For students and educators, these requirements introduce unsurmountable barriers and restrictions.

    This paper presents the motivation, requirements, implementation and evalaution of a new programming platform that enables novice users to create software for embedded systems through the efficient and extensible application of mainstream high level languages. Furthermore, this paper also shows shows how we leverage today's lightweight tooling to provide highly accessible, cross-platform, installation free code editors for embedded systems.
