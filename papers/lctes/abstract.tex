    With a drive to increase computer science literacy, 
    embedded systems have entered the classroom. Historically, embedded systems 
    in this setting require: knowledge of low-level programming languages; 
    local installation of compilation toolchains, device drivers, and applications on PCs; 
    and constant tethered connections to PCs in order for programs to execute. 
    For students and educators, these requirements introduce barriers and restrictions 
    in the classroom.

    We present a new programming platform that makes it easier for students and
    educators to create applications for embedded systems using visual programming
    languages. We leverage today's lightweight tooling to allow code to be developed
    without \emph{any installation}, requiring only a computer with a modern web browser
    and a USB port. Finally, we describe archtectural decisions that we have taken to
    facilitate long, free running Internet of Things applications to enable a new level 
    of creativity for students and educators can explore.

    With the predicted growth of the Internet of Things we believe that a system such 
    as ours, which enables students and educators from diverse backgrounds to develop 
    embedded applications quickly, will become increasingly valuable. After describing 
    our platform in detail, we evaluate performance on a range of modern low-end embedded
    systems, such as XYZ.
