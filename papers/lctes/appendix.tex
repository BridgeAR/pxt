\section{Static TypeScript Subtype Relation}
 

In STS, $S$ is a subtype of a type $T$ if one of the following is true:
\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ and $T$ are identical types;
\item $S$ is the Undefined type;
\item $S$ is the Null type and $T$ is not the Undefined type;
\item $S$ is an enum type and $T$ is the primitive type Number;
\item $S$ is a string literal type and $T$ is the primitive type String;
\item $S$ and $T$ are class types and all the following are true:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $S$ is derived from $T$ (via \emph{extends} clauses);
  \item checkProps($S$,$T$) holds;
\end{itemize}
\item $S$ is a class/record type and $T$ is a record type and
\begin{itemize}
  \item checkProps($S$,$T$) holds;
\end{itemize}
\item $S$ and $T$ are function types such that all the following hold:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $S$ has at least as many parameters as $T$;
  \item each parameter type in $T$ is a subtype of the corresponding parameter type in $S$;
  \item the result type of $T$ is Void, or the result type of $S$ is a subtype of that of $T$;
\end{itemize}
\item $S$ and $T$ are array types and all the following hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item $T$ has a numeric index signature with element type $U$, 
    and $S$ has a numeric index signature with element type $V$
    such that $V$ is a subtype of $U$;
\item checkProps($S$,$T$) holds.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Given types $S$ and $T$, checkProps($S$,$T$) holds if for each property $N$ in $T$, 
$S$ has a property $M$ where all of the following are true:
\begin{itemize}
\item $M$ and $N$ have the same name;
\item the type of $M$ is a subtype of the type of $N$;
\item $M$ and $N$ are both public, or $M$ and $N$ are both 
      private (protected) and originate in the same declaration, 
      or $N$ is protected and $S$ is a class derived from class $T$
\end{itemize}
