\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

We have presented and evaluated a new web-based platform designed to bring modern language features and tooling to microcontrollers. Composing our platform are:

\begin{itemize}

\item \MCN, a \emph{no installation} programming environment, that supports novice programmers with \emph{block-based and text-based higher-level languages}, and compiles programs \emph{in the browser}.

\item \CON, a C++ runtime that \emph{bridges the semantic gap} between higher level languages and C++, thereby enabling the efficient mapping of higher level languages onto native C++ calls,

\item \UFN, a new file format that enables the \emph{driverless}, \emph{efficient}, programming of microcontrollers.

\end{itemize}

Combined, our approach to running higher level languages on microcontrollers is up to 50x more performant than other approaches. Further, by using modern tooling, and higher level languages, our approach lowers the barrier to entry for microcontroller programming. Our aspiration is to engage with, and encourage \emph{everyone} to explore embedded systems.
